# How to Contribute to VdszBot
At the moment there are only a few ways to do it. 
These are:-simply testing it's commands on the Discord server, but of course spamming them will not make you a contributor

-finding bugs

-finding miswrites

-helping in creating new features

-helping in fixing features that don't work as they are supposed to

-contribuzing to already existing features such as the english command.
