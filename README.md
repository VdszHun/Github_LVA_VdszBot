# GitHub VdszHun Repository

A small GitHub Repository for VdszHun. It will be used for testing and stuff like that. Don't expect
a large future for the repository.

# Madness: Project Reborn

Madness: Project Reborn is an animated Madness Combat series focusing on the A.A.H.W
 and the Nexus Core from Madness: Project Nexus. The first episode of the series is under 
development at the moment. Hopefully it will be finished by the end of 2020.

# VdszBot

A Discord bot under development, which will be used only on private servers for
the time being. Sorry but I'm a beginner at the moment.
